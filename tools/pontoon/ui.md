# Understanding the Pontoon User Interface

## Pontoon Translation Workspace

Pontoon's translation workspace features the projects string list in the sidebar on the left and the editing space on the right. The features in the Pontoon user interface are labeled in the image below:

### Menu Bar

The Menu Bar allows you to navigate between projects without leaving the Translation Workspace.

To navigate to another project, click on each item to open the drop-down menu and select the locale, project, and resource to work on. Then click `Go`.

*Note that clicking* `All` *or* `Current` *in the drop-down menu will navigate away from the Translation Workspace.*

A string overview is located to the right of the Menu Bar. Translators can view the overview in detail by clicking it once.

A project information icon is located to the right of the string overview. Translators can view information regarding the project, it's priority level, and testing by clicking the icon.

### Sidebar

The sidebar displays the list of strings in the current project resource. Each string is displayed with the string status (i.e. *Missing*, *Translated*, etc.) marked by a colored square, the source string, and the translation or suggestion if available.

At the top of the sidebar, the translator can access Pontoon's string filters and search. To learn to use search and filters, click [here](search_filters.md).

*Note that the sidebar toggles between the strings and the editing space when in the In-context editor*

### Workspace

The workspace is where strings are translated.

A translator can navigate sequentially by clicking the `Previous` or `Next` buttons located at the top of the workspace.

In the upper section of the workspace, the translator can view the source string, any comments regarding the string, and the resource path where the string is located.

The editing space is located in the lower section of the workspace. The translator can edit the translation or suggestion in the text editor.

To the lower-right side, the translator can `Copy` the source string to the editor, `Clear` the text editor, and `Suggest` or `Save` the translation by clicking the corresponding button.

To the lower-left of the workspace, a translator can access the workspace settings, keyboard shortcuts, and view the number of characters in the target and source string.

By clicking the gear icon, the translator can activate or deactivate `Quality Checks` or `Make Suggestions` and navigate to their user settings.

## Pontoon In-context Editor

Pontoon's In-context editor displays the translatable strings as they appear on the web page alongside the editing space. This means that translators can see how the source string appears and how the translation looks in real time.

*Pontoon's In-context editor shows the strings in context on the right with the translation workbench on the left*

When using the In-context editor, the sidebar features both string navigation and the editing space. To view the editing space, double click on a string. To return to string navigation, click `Back Lo List` at the top-left of the sidebar.
