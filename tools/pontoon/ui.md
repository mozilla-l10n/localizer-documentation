### Main toolbar

The main toolbar allows you to navigate between projects without leaving the Translation Workspace.

Note that clicking* `All` or `Current` in the drop-down menu will navigate away from the Translation Workspace.

A string overview is located to the right of the main toolbar. Translators can view the overview in detail by clicking it once.

A project information icon is located to the right of the string overview. Translators can view information regarding the project, its priority level, and testing by clicking the icon.

The notifications icon is located on the right side of the main toolbar. Translators will be notified of any important updates regarding the current project. By clicking the bell icon, translators can view notifications in more detail or see all active notifications.

The profile menu is located at the far right of the main toolbar. Clicking the profile image will reveal the drop-down menu. From this menu, translators can navigate to their profile page; download translations and translation memories; upload translations; navigate to the pages for contributors, Machinery, terms of use, help, admin, and user settings; or sign out. For information about uploads, downloads, and Machinery, click [here](resources.md).

Note that some profile menu items are restricted by [user rights](users.md).

### Sidebar

The sidebar displays the list of strings in the current project resource. Each string is displayed with the string status (i.e. *Missing*, *Translated*, etc.) marked by a colored square, the source string, and the approved translation or the most recent suggestion if available.

At the top of the sidebar, the translator can access Pontoon's string filters and search. Learn how to use [search and filters](search_filters.md).

Note that the sidebar toggles between the strings and the editing space when in the in-context editor

### Workspace

The workspace is where strings are translated.

A translator can navigate sequentially by clicking the `PREVIOUS` or `NEXT` buttons located at the top of the workspace or by using keyboard shortcuts.

In the upper section of the workspace, the translator can view the source string, any comments regarding the string, and the resource path where the string is located.

The editing space is located in the lower section of the workspace. The translator can edit the translation or suggestion in the text editor.

To the lower-right side, the translator can `COPY` the source string to the editor, `CLEAR` the text editor, and `SUGGEST` or `SAVE` the translation by clicking the corresponding button.

To the lower-left of the workspace, a translator can access the workspace settings, keyboard shortcuts, and view the number of characters in the target and source string.

By clicking the gear icon, the translator can activate or deactivate `Quality Checks` or `Make Suggestions` and navigate to their user settings.

## Pontoon in-context editor

Pontoon's in-context editor displays the translatable strings as they appear on the web page alongside the editing space. This means that translators can see how the source string appears and how the translation looks in real time. Pontoon's in-context editor shows the strings in context on the right with the translation workbench on the left

![in-context editor](/assets/images/pontoon/ui/incontext_edit.png)

When using the in-context editor, the sidebar features both string navigation and the editing space. To view the editing space, double click on a string. To return to string navigation, click `BACK TO LIST` at the top-left of the sidebar.
