At the left of the entry, a diff view of the current source string and the source string from the machinery resource is visible. Red-highlighted text indicates text that is present in the current string that is not in the machinery string. Green-highlighted text indicates text that is present in the machinery string that is not present in the current project string.

To the right of the entry, the number in green shows the percent match between the machinery string and the current string. The higher the percentage, the more likely the machinery is to be useful. The machinery source is listed in gray. Upon clicking the gray text, the machinery source will be opened in a new window. The green superscript to the right of the source indicates the number of entries for the entry string in the source.
