# Fluent for localizers

<!-- toc -->

Fluent is a localization paradigm, designed at Mozilla [as part of L20n](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent/wiki/Fluent-and-L20n), to unleash the expressive power of the natural language. The format used to describe translation resources used by Fluent is called `FTL`.

This section of documentation includes a brief introduction to Fluent’s syntax for localizers and covers specific details regarding Mozilla’s implementation (branding rules, Gecko BUILT-INs, etc.). For a detailed overview of Fluent, consult the [official documentation](http://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/).
