# Guide to promoting Firefox in your language: a community marketing kit

For a community new or well established, it is always exciting to reach the milestone when the localized Firefox is ready for the first or a major release.  It takes months of translation, testing and QA to get to the finish line. However, the work is not done.  Now it comes to the challenging part of promoting the product in your language and spreading the word of mouth.  In anticipation for the new Firefox launch in the autumn, this guide is intended to address some of the most frequently questions you asked.

The team is not ready to expand to more locales due to manual process to launch them.  You can use leverage the content you see fit and publish them on your community social channels. We are in discussion with the Snippets team to support occasional request for locales not regularly supported. Check [Localizing and Testing Snippets] doc for details.

## Spreading the words

Here are a few channels to spread the words of the new Firefox launch. The followings are mere suggestions. They may or may not be applicable or appropriate for every market.

* Social media: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Blogs
* Community: organize meetup, attend other tech meetups, be a speaker
* Organization: team up with other tech NGOs, schools, universities, and libraries to discuss web or tech literacy); bulletin board
* Mozilla: Mozillagram will share photos from events
* With advance planning, Snippets team will push localized snippets outside of the regularly supported locales (link to Snippet doc in the request section)
* Mozilla l10n blog, monthly report

## Guidelines to organizing events

Large events are not scalable due to limited budget. Here are a few things to keep in mind when organizing a locale event:

* To organize an event, reach out to your local Reps personnel (not the Reps program). The Reps are experienced in organizing events, especially the logistics
* To fund the event, send request to the l10n team in advance.  The l10n team will set aside a small budget for it
* For new locale launch, in addition to the above steps:

  * L10n team will send swags (pens, stickers) for the events
  * L10n team will send t-shirts to the community localizers
