# Search and filters

Strings in Pontoon can be filtered by their state. A string can be in one of the following states:
* *Missing*: string is not available in the localized file and doesn’t have any translations or suggestions in Pontoon.
* *Suggested*: at least one suggestion has been submitted for this string. Note that, in this case, the translation only exists within Pontoon database, it’s not saved to the localized file.
* *Translated*: string has an approved translation.
* *Fuzzy*: string is marked as [fuzzy](../../misc/glossary.md#fuzzy) in the localized file.

Suggestions can be in two states:
* *Unreviewed*: string has been suggested, but not approved or rejected.
* *Rejected*: string has been reviewed and rejected by a translator.

There are some extra criteria that can be used to filter strings:
* *Untranslated*: this will display strings that are either suggested, missing, or fuzzy. Basically, anything but translated. Once selected, you will also notice that those 3 filters are automatically checked.
* *Unchanged*: string is identical to the reference language (normally en-US).
* *Unreviewed suggestions*: this will display strings that have at least one unreviewed suggestion. Note that it will include strings in *suggested*, *fuzzy* and *translated* state, as long as they have unreviewed suggestions.
* *Rejected*: show strings that have rejected suggestions.

By clicking on the funnel icon on the left, it’s possible to access filters.

At this point it’s possible to:
* Click directly on the description of one of the filters. This will select and activate only this filter, and the search field placeholder will change accordingly. For example, clicking on *Missing* will show only missing strings, and the placeholder will read *Search in Missing*.
* Click on the icons for each filter, or the user avatars, in order to apply multiple filters. When you hover the icons, you will notice that they transform into checkmarks. A new button *APPLY X FILTERS* will appear at the bottom of the panel, where `X` is the number of active filters.

![Multiple filters](/assets/images/pontoon/search_filters/filters_multiple.png)

In this case 3 filters are selected.

To select a **time range**, you need to click *EDIT RANGE*, then either pick one of the defaults (30 days, 7 days, 24 hours, 60 minutes), or use the date picker (or slider) to adapt the range. Click on *SAVE RANGE* to store the range, then apply the filter.

It’s possible to search within a project using the search field. Searches include strings, string IDs and comments.

Note that searches take active filters into account, for example a search would be performed only on missing strings if that filter is selected.
