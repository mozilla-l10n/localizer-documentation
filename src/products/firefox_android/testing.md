# Testing Firefox for Android

## Testing on Nightly builds

Once you have localized [all the strings needed to complete the Firefox for Android project](how_to_localize.md), and your language is now up on [Nightly builds](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.fenix), you should start testing! This is the moment to engage as much people as possible: have them use and check-out these builds regularly. The more eyes on them, the better.

### What to look out for?

(For more detailed explanations about testing, please refer to [testing localization of Mozilla projects](l10n_testing.md))

* Language quality.
* Truncated words (cut-off from screen).
* Anything that appears broken on the UI.
* Check out at all the main screens, UI, menus, tabs, new features, etc. Make sure these all look good, that everything is properly translated and appears as expected.
* Font support.
* Check that all searchplugins are working correctly.

It is strongly suggested to start using these Nightly builds on a daily basis (and even once your locale is shipping on release version), so that you can get into as many screens as possible and check that everything looks fine.

It is important that the people testing the localization be not only the one(s) who have localized. Ask other people from your community to help test in order to have fresh eyes looking at your work.
