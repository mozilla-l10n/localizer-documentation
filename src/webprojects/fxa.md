# Firefox Accounts (FxA): how to localize and test

Firefox Accounts (or FxA) refers to https://accounts.firefox.com/signin. Every month, tens of millions of active internet users have logged in to a Firefox account, of which, more than half of the users worldwide choose localized versions. Firefox Accounts lets you access to a slew of Firefox products and services through the Firefox browsers on desktop and mobile devices: Lockwise, Pocket, Monitor, Screenshots, Send, and Sync. By using the same account, you can log into [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/) and [SuMo](https://support.mozilla.org) to start contributing to localization.

There are three components in Pontoon that make up [FxA](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/firefox-accounts/):

* `LC_MESSAGES/client.po`: the content server for UI and frontend
* `LC_MESSAGES/server.po`: strings for emails and backend templates
* `Main.ftl`: payments for both frontend and backend

The above could change over time as the team is planning to migrate .po files to .ftl, which may involve restructuring the files.

## Key links

* Production: https://accounts.firefox.com/
* Staging: https://latest.dev.lcip.org/
* Repository: https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server-l10n
* Pontoon: https://pontoon.mozilla.org/de/firefox-accounts/

## Localizing the strings

FxA lives in two file formats.  The shorter a string is, especially the kind containing variable or placeable, the more context you need to make sure you get the translation right. Look for clues or ask others for clarification:

* String comments: Pay attention to the comment or string ID. In Pontoon, the comments are displayed above the area where you can enter your translation for a string. Some strings are used in more than one place. Finding the appropriate translation that works broadly is important.
* [Matrix channel](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#l10n-community:mozilla.org): ping the L10n PM in charge with any issues you may have.
* [Web projects mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/mozilla.dev.l10n.web): Raise questions here so others may benefit from the information.

## Breaking the code, breaking the build

Sometimes a string contains a lot of codes. It involves moving the words around so the string sounds natural in your language. In the process, a code may be accidentally altered. Any code alteration will break the build!

For .po file format, a few FxA contacts would be notified when a code in localized string is broken. Any subsequent commits by other localizers in other languages will trigger this warning until the broken string is fixed by one of the people notified. Here are a few common errors seen in localized content:

üëç Correct example: `The recipient‚Äôs consent is required. <a %(escapedLearnMoreAttributes)s>Learn more</a>`<br>
üëé Spacing in the code is strict. Omitted or inserted space is not allowed: `The recipient‚Äôs consent is required. <a%(escapedLearnMoreAttributes)s >`Learn more</a>.<br>
üëé Attributes should remain unchanged: `<span Á±ªÂà´="Êï∞Â≠ó">2</span>Point the camera at the QR code and tap the link that appears.`<br>
üëé Markups come in pairs, not partial: `<h1 id="fxa-cad-qr-connect-your-mobile-device-header">Connect your mobile device</h1<p>with a QR code we've created just for you<p>.`

For .ftl file format, such error checking mechanism is not in place either in Pontoon or GitHub: Pontoon doesn‚Äôt have a warning, and the FxA repository doesn‚Äôt send out notifications. Before a script is developed to catch the errors, please use the above examples as general guidelines to avoid making the common mistakes.

## Testing

Product updates are deployed to Pontoon on Fridays. Localized content is pushed to production on Tuesdays. Localized strings in Pontoon syncs with fxa-content-server-l10n in GitHub every 10 minutes, making the repository the source of truth.

You can test on either staging and production , both involve having an account in order to access the environment. The payment feature will be rolling out to international markets through wave releases. It‚Äôs best to review localization work on the staging environment before the feature is launched to the market.

Firefox Accounts can be tested through Firefox browsers for desktop and mobile. In addition to following [the general localization testing guidelines](../products/l10n_testing.md), there are features unique to the product that need special attention. Make sure you test them thoroughly.

### Testing account setup

#### Linguistic testing:

* Login screen
* Email notification
* Check all the setting configuration buttons and the page or expanded window each page leads to
* Translation is of good quality and makes sense in context
* No broken UI, especially in a mobile environment. Text wraps or line breaks correctly.
* Terms are consistent between pages
* Basic font support
* Error and warning messages

#### Functionality testing:

* Configure the setting. Go through all of the categories
* Check for email notifications with each of the initial setups
* Make changes to some of the setting, check for possible error message or warning; check for followup confirmation emails

### Testing the subscription platform

The subscription platform (or sub plat) consists of a few features. Right now only the `Payment and subscription creation` is available for testing:

* `Payment and subscription creation`: The initial payment funnel where users enter their credit card information to subscribe to a product. Mozilla partners with Stripe to handle this
* `Billing`: Ongoing billing and receipt emails once a subscription is entered
* `Subscription management UI`: Settings that allow the user to update their payment information

Payment testing is tied to the language of user preference and location. Payment service is market specific. For instance, the product is available in German, but the service is available in Germany but not in Switzerland.

#### Before testing:

* Have a Firefox account. If you don‚Äôt have one, the staging link will take you to the signup process.
* Choose a Firefox browser for: desktop (Windows only), Android, or iOS. Support for macOS and Linux is coming soon.
* Set the language you are testing in your browser.
* Use a VPN to configure to the desired location if you are not physically in the correct language and country/region combination.
* Staging for [Firefox Privacy Network](https://stage.guardian.nonprod.cloudops.mozgcp.net/).
* [Stripe test credit cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#international-cards); Select the region above the table first, then look for the country code in the credit card numbers. It is likely your particular country is not listed. Stay tuned for workaround and news for expanded offers at a later time.

**Tips:** Feeling not having enough test accounts to use for testing? You are not alone. Here are some tips you can consider:

* Add number(s) or letter(s) to your existing account to create more accounts by adding a `+` in your email address. For example, if your main email is `abc@xyz.com`, your expanded accounts could be `abc+1@xyz.com` and `abc+m@xyz.com`. You will receive email notifications in your `abc@xyz.com` inbox. You can add anything you want, several digits and/or letters.
* Keep your password simple so you can log in and log out easily. Keep track of which account is connected with which password. Of course, there is Lockwise for the rescue!

#### Testing payment and subscription creation

* Go to [Firefox Privacy Network](https://stage.guardian.nonprod.cloudops.mozgcp.net/)
* Click on the **Subscribe** button which takes you to a subscription form. If you don't have a Firefox account at this point, you will need to create one.
* Fill out all the required fields with any made up information you want, as long as the format conforms to the requirement for your market.
* Credit card number: Use one of the [Stripe test credit card numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#international-cards) corresponding to the location you are in physically or virtually
* Check formatting accuracy for date and currency. Check the box on usage agreement.
* Click on **Pay Now**
* An email confirmation arrives in your inbox. The content should match the summary on the page you just completed your subscription.
* A *Thank You* payment confirmation message appears with the subscription summary on your browser page with an invitation to download. Click on **Continue to Download**.
* It takes you to the Firefox Privacy Network (FPN) add-on download page. Click on **+ Add to Firefox** button. A series of pop-up windows will walk you through the installation process, and where to find and manage your FPN.
* The FPN icon will appear on the Firefox browser toolbar. Click on the icon and log in with your Firefox account.
* Click on **Manage Account** in the dropdown window, it will take you to your account setting.
* Click on **Subscriptions and Payments** in the **Setting** page, which shows the summary of your payment setup.

**Note**, the Privacy Notice and Terms of Use documents are not localized in all the languages where the product is offered. When not available, you will be redirected to the English versions.
