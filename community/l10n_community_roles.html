<p>Volunteer communities are the backbone of the localization (l10n) efforts at Mozilla. They are designed to be self-regulating and self-managing with minimal intervention from staff. For example, the responsibility of reviewing suggestions falls on the Translators and Managers within the community; they not only ensure quality and consistency but also keep an eye out for potential new volunteers to promote. And when Managers plan to step down, it’s crucial they develop succession plans to maintain continuity.</p>
<p>The role of staff is to intervene only when necessary. The main reasons for staff to be involved is when self-regulation fails or there are violations of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/">Community Participation Guidelines</a> (CPG). The goal is to empower the communities to thrive independently while maintaining the high standards that Mozilla is known for.</p>
<p>The localization team can occasionally take a more hands-on approach, proactively engaging with locales that are facing challenges. For example, it can happen when a member (or members) of a locale reaches out directly to localization staff to express concerns about their community. Other times, the team may receive product requests for specific locales, which prompts initiatives to ensure that these communities are capable of supporting the product expansion.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we’ll review the current roles and expectations and suggest guidelines for when role criteria are not met — and how the localization staff can get involved and help in these different scenarios.</p>

<li>Testing of all submitted translations in product.</li>
<li>Work with Managers to create and maintain language resources for the community.</li>

<li>Gracefully accept feedback on their translations from other Translators and Managers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contributors"><a class="header" href="#contributors">Contributors</a></h3>
<h4 id="responsibilities-2"><a class="header" href="#responsibilities-2">Responsibilities</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Submit translation suggestions to Pontoon projects for the target language.</li>
<li>Request and accept feedback from Translators and Managers in the community.</li>
<li>In-context review (l10n testing) of translation suggestions that have been approved by Translators and Managers.</li>
</ul>

<li>Avoid relying exclusively on machine translation, especially when unsure about the source string or the language.</li>
<li>Proactively request feedback from Translators and Managers.</li>
<li>Network and form relationships with others in the community.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guidelines"><a class="header" href="#guidelines">Guidelines</a></h2>
<h3 id="promotions"><a class="header" href="#promotions">Promotions</a></h3>
<p>Promotions apply to Translators and Contributors. Managers and localization staff can directly <a href="../tools/pontoon/users.html#managing-permissions">promote/demote users</a> to Translator or Manager roles.</p>
<h4 id="efforts-to-revive-an-inactive-community"><a class="header" href="#efforts-to-revive-an-inactive-community">Efforts to revive an inactive community</a></h4>
<p>A community is considered inactive when there are no other active Translators or Managers, which can make it difficult for Contributors to participate effectively. If a Contributor has attempted to reach out to the Managers or Translators but has not received a satisfactory response (or any response) within a few weeks, it’s advisable to <a href="#how-can-i-contact-the-localization-staff">contact the localization staff</a> for assistance. Each situation is unique, and staff can help investigate further, for example reviewing a localizer’s contribution history across external localization projects outside of Mozilla. The localization team will also reach out to former Managers and Translators for their input. If there is still no response, the localization team will consider promoting active localizers who have expressed interest in taking on an active role.</p>
<h4 id="community-engagement"><a class="header" href="#community-engagement">Community engagement</a></h4>
<p>Localizers who actively participate in community discussions, provide feedback and reviews, mentor new members, and engage in localization events and workshops should be recognized and promoted for their dedication and leadership within the community​. They often transition from direct translation work to more managerial roles, focusing on building and enabling the locale community.</p>
<p>How do you recognize and promote them? Existing locale Managers are typically in charge of updating the permissions on Pontoon. Staff will step in if there are reasons preventing a person from reaching the next role (for example, if there are no active Managers, or if there is <a href="#gatekeeping">gatekeeping</a>).</p>
<p>In the case there is no existing community, a localizer requesting a new locale will be appointed to the Manager role.</p>
<h4 id="high-quality-contributions"><a class="header" href="#high-quality-contributions">High-quality contributions</a></h4>
<p>A localizer who consistently provides high-quality translations that meet the community’s standards should be considered for promotion. This includes accuracy, adherence to style guides, and timely contributions and reviews​. Contribution data on Pontoon can be used to help guide these decisions.</p>
<h3 id="demotions"><a class="header" href="#demotions">Demotions</a></h3>
<p>Demotions should come as a last resort when a localizer’s actions significantly impact the project’s quality, collaboration, or community. In practice demotions are extremely rare and historically have occurred when a Manager or Translator voluntarily expresses a desire to step back from their roles and expectations.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of reasons for demotion.</p>
<h4 id="a-localizer-wants-to-take-a-step-back"><a class="header" href="#a-localizer-wants-to-take-a-step-back">A localizer wants to take a step back</a></h4>
<p>As explained, a request for demotion can come from localizers themselves, when they want to delegate certain responsibilities. This is a straightforward scenario, in which a localizer typically will reach out to the manager — or localization staff — to express their desire to step down. Managers have the permissions to do so themselves, but localization staff can also assist.</p>
<h4 id="a-localizer-is-failing-to-meet-role-expectations"><a class="header" href="#a-localizer-is-failing-to-meet-role-expectations">A localizer is failing to meet role expectations</a></h4>
<p>A localizer might notice that a Manager or Translator is abusing their role, especially in ways that may be considered <a href="#gatekeeping">gatekeeping</a>. After the community has tried to get in touch with the Managers or Translators, but has not received a satisfactory response (or any response) after a few weeks, <a href="#how-can-i-contact-the-localization-staff">reaching out to the localization staff</a> is a good first step for the team to help investigate and find solutions, as each situation is unique. Note that the localization team rarely demotes anyone unless it’s a grave situation, but they can help promote or unblock users.</p>
<h4 id="prolonged-inactivity"><a class="header" href="#prolonged-inactivity">Prolonged inactivity</a></h4>
<p>Typically there isn’t a need to demote a Manager or Translator due to inactivity, unless <a href="#gatekeeping">gatekeeping</a> or retaliation disrupt the work of others.</p>
<h3 id="community-guidelines-enforcement"><a class="header" href="#community-guidelines-enforcement">Community guidelines enforcement</a></h3>
<h4 id="cpg-violation"><a class="header" href="#cpg-violation">CPG violation</a></h4>
<p>A CPG violation is taken very seriously and will be addressed immediately. The process for reporting a violation is detailed under the “Reporting” section of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/">CPG</a>.</p>
<h4 id="gatekeeping"><a class="header" href="#gatekeeping">Gatekeeping</a></h4>
<p>Gatekeeping can show up in different ways in localization communities/localizers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not reviewing new Contributors’ work, which prevents them from joining and contributing.</li>
<li>Self-reviewing their own work and ignoring the work done by others — or constantly rejecting others’ contributions as not good enough to maintain control over the locale.</li>
<li>Creating unnecessary barriers to participation, like setting very strict standards without offering guidance or feedback, holding onto knowledge or resources instead of sharing with the community, and resisting changes or improvements suggested by others without explanation.</li>
<li>Being inactive for a long period of time, but nonetheless never wanting to give permissions to others actively participating.
These actions limit the growth and diversity of the community, making it less welcoming and inclusive.</li>
</ul>
<p>How does the localization team know someone is gatekeeping? This can happen through direct feedback, or through the localization team’s own investigations.</p>
<p>If a localizer has attempted to reach out to Managers or Translators but has not received a satisfactory response (or any response) within 2 weeks, it’s advisable to contact the localization staff for assistance.</p>
