# Roles within Mozilla l10n communities

Within Mozilla l10n communities, each individual is organized into one of three roles: Locale manager, Translator, Contributor. These roles reflect the community structure within Pontoon as well. Each l10n community has its own unique implementation of these roles, but there is a baseline set of responsibilities and expectations that Mozilla places on those contributing to localization.

This document defines the roles within each l10n community, as well as the responsibilities and expectations of each. We also define what the l10n-driver responsibilities and expectations are with regard to the community as a whole. Here we define responsibilities as what each individual commits to by accepting their role in the community. We define expectations as how you carry yourself in the role.

## Implementation

Each community implements these roles according to their own cultural and unique situations. In some smaller communities, everyone may be Managers and the responsibilities for the role is shared among them. In other communities, there will be one Manager, several Translators, and many Contributors. We respect each community’s rights to implement these roles as best works for them, while maintaining emphasis of each role’s responsibilities and expectations.

Evaluations to determine whether someone should increase in their role should not be done in a vacuum, but in consultation with other experienced localizers within the community. Typically, roles are increased for a community member when they have proven themselves to satisfy the responsibilities and expectations of their role, even going above and beyond what’s expected.
